  Welcome to the online home of The Draw, a land-based regenerative community;
  Stewards Draw nonprofit; and Waters Edge Nursery & Gardens. We hope this
  website also serves as an online resource for regenerative design.  Thanks
  for visiting.

  ## About The Draw

  We choose to manifest a life in which we embody the truth of our
  interconnectedness with all that is, and we commit all that we are to creating
  health at all levels of being. We believe that the Earth is sacred and we have
  chosen a lifeway in which we are healers of her. For us, nothing that does harm
  to her is worth the price that must be paid by the future of all life. We
  believe we must expand our concept of “self” to include our family, community,
  and land. We choose to become indigenous: saturating the land with meaning and
  story, animating her, blessing her, realizing we are a part of her.

  From our indigenous, animistic, permaculture story we attempt to bring forth
  a diverse and fecund ecosystem that will nourish our ‘whole body’. We create
  food forests, marshes, savannah, and perennially-mulched no-till annual
  polycultures to re-envision food production. Using highly efficient heaters,
  super-insulated naturally built buildings, and appropriate site design we
  decrease our negative impact. Our life is our love made evident.
