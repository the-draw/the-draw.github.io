Waters Edge Nursery & Gardens is located on the property of The Draw LLC, a land-based regenerative community on the south shore of Lake Superior. We are listed in US agricultural zone 4B with a growing season of 120–150 days. Our plants are well suited for our unique bio-region and most will grow successfully in zone 4 (some in zones 3, 2, and 1).

We use only biological controls attempting to create cultivated ecosystem. In our nursery we focus on root growth to produce healthy plants that will thrive in your landscape.  We invite you to come and see first-hand our cultivation practices. It is best to contact us to set-up an appointment; though you can just stop by as we are usually around.  We will be happy to help figure out the right plants for your situation.
